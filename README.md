# Forecasting SIDFEX buoys  from NeXtSIM-F sea ice forecast
This repository contains the tools and tutorials  to forecast the  trajectories of the [SIDFEX buoys](https://www.polarprediction.net/key-yopp-activities/sea-ice-prediction-and-verification/sea-ice-drift-forecast-experiment/) from the [sea ice forecast based on the NeXtSIM-F model](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description).

### In this repository, you will find:
* a [tutorial](./NOTEBOOKS/HOWTO.md) to set up and make use of the tools,
* the required [scripts and codes](./SRC/) to produce the forecast,
* example notebooks to plot and explore the produced forecasted trajectories.
  _!!! NOTE: As of today 2024-05-18 the set up of this repository is still on-going. Do not use before it is ready to be used. !!!._
