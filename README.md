# Forecasting SIDFEX buoys  from NeXtSIM-F sea ice forecast
This repository contains the tools and tutorials  to forecast the  trajectories of the [SIDFEX buoys](https://www.polarprediction.net/key-yopp-activities/sea-ice-prediction-and-verification/sea-ice-drift-forecast-experiment/) from the [sea ice forecast based on the NeXtSIM-F model](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description).

### In this repository, you will find:
* a [tutorial](./NOTEBOOKS/HOWTO.md) to set up and make use of the tools,
* the required [scripts and codes](./SRC/) to produce the forecast,
* example notebooks to plot and explore the produced forecasted trajectories.
  
  _!!! NOTE: As of today 2024-05-18 the set up of this repository is still on-going. Do not use before it is ready to be used. !!!._

### Our forecatsts for SIDFEX buoys are available here:

### Short method description
9-day hourly forecasts are derived from the forecasting system neXtSIM forecast (neXtSIM-F; Williams et al., 2021), based on the stand-alone sea-ice model neXt-generation Sea Ice Model (neXtSIM; Rampal et al., 2016, 2019), and the Lagrangian sea-ice particle tracker, sitrack (https://github.com/brodeau/sitrack) developed by L. Brodeau. 
The Lagranian finite element model, neXtSIM, is run with a nominal triangle side length of 10 km, with an approximate distance of  7.5 km from one point of a triangle to the opposite edge. It operates with the novel brittle Bingham-Maxwell (BBM) sea-ice rheology of Ólason et al. (2022). neXtSIM-F, developed at NERSC in Bergen/Norway (https://nersc.no), is forced by the operational TOPAZ ocean forecasts and ECMWF atmospheric forecasts. It is run operationally every day for the Arctic domain, and distributed via the Copernicus Marine Data Store (https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/product/ARCTIC_ANALYSISFORECAST_PHY_ICE_002_011/description). The initial conditions are adjusted daily using ice charts from the United States National Ice Center, and ice thickness from CS2-SMOS. The forecast sea-ice concentration and sea-ice velocity given by neXtSIM-F are used as inputs for sitrack. Tracking is stopped if a buoy enters a cell with a sea-ice concentration below 15 %. The neXtSIM-F-sitrack trajectory forecasts, produced following the processing chain developed by Grung, Leroux and Rampal and freely accessible on GitHub (https://github.com/datlas-ocean/Sidfex-NextsimF), are initiated at midnight (UTC+1) of the bulletin date. If the last updated buoy position was within one day prior to initialisation, sitrack uses the hindcast provided by neXtSIM-F to advect the buoy to ensure an approximate position at midnight.
